# Finance-scrape

The theme of this project is sound frugal investments as prescribed by Graham Stephen in his book "The Intelligent Investor".

The seven criteria he outlines are:

1. Adequate Size of the Enterprise - To exclude small companies that may be subject to tighter fiinancial constrictions 
(Lower lines of credit, higher interest rates, &c.). In 1970 Graham proposes that the devensive investor should limit themselves
to companies with at least a 50 miilion market cap. To adjust for inflation we will only consider those with a market cap at least
345 million USD.

2. A Sufficiently Strong Financial Condition - This is a difficult figure to clasify but Graham settles that if an industrial
company has a current ratio of at least 2, and all companies should have a long term debt not exceeding their net working capital
(NWC defined as current assets - current liabilities)

3. Earnings Stability - Some earnings for the common stock in each of the past 10 years.

4. Dividend Record - Uninterupted payments for at least the past 20 years.

5. Earnings growth - A minimum growth of 33% in earnings per share in the past 10 years (Using a 3 year average)

6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio - Current Price should be no more than 15 times average earnings.

7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets - Current price should not exceed 1.5 times the book value last reported.
