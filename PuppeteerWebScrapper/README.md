# Finance-scrape

The theme of this project is sound frugal investments as prescribed by Graham Stephen in his book "The Intelligent Investor".

There are 2 parts of this project

1) A python webscape for financial data on all S&P 500 companies. Given a list of the 500 companies names and tickers this scrape should yield the following data ... .
2) A javascript webscrape finding the current market price of each of the equities. As the first data set is released every quater it should be static whereas market cap is a dynamic statistic and should be updated upon request. A likely extenision will be the ability to extend the javascript webscape for user inputted compaies.
